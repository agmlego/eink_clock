# E-Ink Clock

A personal project to run a wall clock in my bedroom, using a Raspberry Pi Zero and a [Waveshare 12.48" bicolor e-ink display](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/12.48inch_e-Paper_Module). The long-term goal is to connect it with my local `home-assistant` instance to display weather and house alerts, and to one or more Google Calendars to display upcoming events.

NOTE: The Waveshare `epd12in48b` module must be in your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable.
